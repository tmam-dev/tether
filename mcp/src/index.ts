/**
 * Trail MCP server — lets coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, …)
 * stream their work into Trail as traces.
 *
 * The agent authenticates with a Trail API key pair (env vars) and calls
 * these tools; each call becomes a span with Trail's gen_ai.* semantics, so
 * runs appear in Observations → Tracing (full tree), errors in Exceptions,
 * and agent/tool rollups in Analytics → Agents — no UI changes required.
 *
 * Tools:
 *   trail_start_run      begin a run (returns run_id)
 *   trail_log_step       record a task or tool step
 *   trail_log_llm_call   record an LLM call with messages/completion + usage
 *   trail_log_exception  record a failure (shows in Exceptions)
 *   trail_finish_run     close the run (emits the root agent span)
 *
 * Server construction (state, tool registration, the pure span-building
 * functions) lives in tools.ts, kept separate so it can be imported by
 * tests without this file's stdio transport connection running.
